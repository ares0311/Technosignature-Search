#
# turbo_seti==2.3.2 (the exact version pinned in pyproject.toml's `radio`
# extra, and the newest release on PyPI as of 2026-07-11 -- there is no
# newer upstream version to bump to) has a real off-by-one bug in
# find_doppler.py: a debug-log line formats `max_val.total_n_hits` (a
# length-1 numpy array, by design -- three other call sites in the same
# file correctly index it as `total_n_hits[0]`) directly with `%i`,
# omitting the `[0]` index used everywhere else. Older numpy silently
# coerced a length-1 array in `%` string formatting; numpy>=2.0 (which pip
# resolves to by default, since turbo_seti declares no numpy upper bound)
# no longer does, so the run crashes on this trailing debug-log statement
# -- after the real hit-finding work for that coarse channel is already
# done and written to file.
#
# This lives in .venv/site-packages, which is never committed to git and
# is wiped on every fresh venv/extras install, so the one-line fix does
# not survive a venv rebuild on its own. Run this script once after any
# `pip install -e ".[radio]"` (or equivalent) to reapply it. Idempotent --
# safe to run repeatedly.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/patch_turbo_seti_numpy2_compat.sh
#   bash scripts/patch_turbo_seti_numpy2_compat.sh --python /path/to/venv/bin/python
